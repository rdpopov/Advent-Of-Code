Starting the problem i didn't even know that the solution existed, but it looked
like a solved problem. Now, after doing some research modular exponentation is
the answer.

To find the power of the modular exponent , you need t find the number, with
this formula f(x,y) = sum(1,(x+y-2)) + y - 1 (since the first one is just
20151125 and is not raised)
